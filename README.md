Othelo Game I made as a student for a course on C# and Object Oriented Programming.

Seeing it after 4 years, it looks like a complete mess.

I would like to refactor it from time to time and maybe add some features to it.

If anyone wants to use it, feel free to do so.

I'll try to document my refactoring as best as I can so people may get some learning experience off of it.
